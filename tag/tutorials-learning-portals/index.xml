Further it aims to serve as a framework where large-scale neuroscience projects can expose their data to the neuroscience community-at-large. KnowledgeSpace is a framework that combines general descriptions of neuroscience concepts found in wikipedia with more detailed content from NeuroLex. It then integrates the content from those two sources with the latest neuroscience citations found in PubMed and data found in some of the world’s leading neuroscience repositories. KnowledgeSpace is a joint development between the Human Brain Project (HBP), the International Neuroinformatics Coordinating Facility (INCF), and the Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>KnowledgeSpace is currently being developed with funding from the European Union&amp;rsquo;s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under the Specific Grant Agreement No. 945539 (Human Brain Project SGA3), INCF, and Neuroscience Information Framework (NIF). Earlier development was supported by the European Union&amp;rsquo;s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under the Framework Partnership Agreement No. 650003 (HBP FPA), INCF, NIF, and the Blue Brain Project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>KS builds on a vocabulary service, populated with an integrated set of neuroscience ontologies with initial content coming from the Neuroscience Lexicon (NeuroLex), and the Brain Architecture Management System (BAMS). It links to an expanding set of data sources through the NIF federated search infrastructure.&lt;/p>

Access to Neurostars is free to the neuroscience community thanks to the generous support of our sponsors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Neurostars is a forum for research questions, software, infrastructure, scientific societies, and virtual courses, including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Software developers and infrastructure providers in need of a mechanism in which to engage and provide support to user communities and those in need of a platform to integrate tutorials and discussion forums (via INCF TrainingSpace)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Scientific societies in need of a forum for knowledge exchange and support between members&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Virtual course organizers in need of an archivable Q &amp;amp; A forum to support learning in their courses where access can be restricted to registered participants with automated notifications and the ability to have multiple, linked subdiscussion groups&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Individuals in need of sharing ideas, asking questions and finding answers, and helping others within neuroscience without any cost&lt;/li>

&lt;p>INCF advances data reuse and reproducibility in brain research by coordinating the development of Open, FAIR, and Citable tools and resources for neuroscience&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The global INCF network&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>supports the development of neuroinformatics as a discipline&lt;/li>
&lt;li>moves neuroscience towards FORCE (a FAIR, Open, Research-object based, Citable Ecosystem)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>provides coordination of global neuroscience infrastructure through the development and endorsement of consensus-based standards and best practices&lt;/li>
&lt;li>trains scientists, administrators, and students in using neuroinformatics tools and methods&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>INCF provides materials, expertise, training, and standards and best practices for: 1) scientists seeking to improve their science through neuroinformatics, 2) infrastructure providers so they can do their jobs better and participate in the global network, and 3) those seeking to add their tools, services, and expertise to the INCF network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>INCF currently has Governing and Associate Nodes spanning 4 continents, with an extended network comprising organizations, individual researchers, industry, and publishers. The INCF Secretariat supports the Nodes with outreach, project management, and administration of community-driven projects.&lt;/p>

We demonstrate the versatility of this framework by tracking various body parts in multiple species across a broad collection of behaviors.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The package is open source, fast, robust, and can be used to compute 3D pose estimates. Please see the original paper and the latest work below. This package is collaboratively developed by the Mathis Group &amp;amp; Mathis Lab at EPFL/Harvard.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The code is freely available and easy to install in a few clicks with Anaconda (and pypi). Please see instructions on deeplabcut.org. We also provide a very easy to use GUI interface, and a step-by-step user guide!&lt;/p>

Many scientists have benefited from the high-quality, ready-to-use AAV prep service from Addgene, a nonprofit plasmid repository. However, it can be challenging to determine which AAV tool and techniques are best to use for an experiment. Scientists also may have questions about how much virus to inject or which serotype or promoter should be used to target the desired neuron or brain region. To help scientists answer these questions, Addgene launched an open platform called the AAV Data Hub (&lt;a href="https://datahub.addgene.org/aav/">https://datahub.addgene.org/aav/&lt;/a>) which allows researchers to easily share practical experimental details with the scientific community (AAV used, in vivo model used, injection site, injection volumes, etc.). The goal of this platform is to help scientists find the best AAV tool for their experiments by reviewing combined data from a broad range of research labs. The AAV Data Hub launched in late 2019 and over 100 experiments have since been contributed to this project. The dataset includes details and images from experiments conducted in six different species and several different expression sites.&lt;/p>
