&lt;p>“Backyard brains wants to be for neuroscience, what the telescope is for astronomers” – meaning that the idea is that with a couple of hundred dollars anyone can get one of these recording systems and start doing experiments, like amateur astronomers can buy telescopes and start observing the cosmos.&lt;/p>

Their ultimate goal is to create a system optimized for tetrodes and optogenetics where one is able to record and analyse data in real-time. On the &lt;a href="http://www.open-ephys.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project’s website&lt;/a> one can download plans on how to build the devices and estimate on part cost (which is much, much lower than commercially available systems out there).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
