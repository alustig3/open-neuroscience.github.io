The performance of Openspritzer and commercial alternatives is effectively indistinguishable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The system is based on a solenoid valve connected to a pressure gauge. Control can be attained directly via an external TTL pulse or internally through an Arduino set by a rotary encoder. The basic setup can be put together for 3-400€, or substantially less if you are prepare to shop around.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We anticipate that due to its high performance and low cost Openspritzer will be of interest to a broad range of researchers working in the life and physical sciences.&lt;/p>

Our solution is an open-source hardware that allows for automatic high-throughput generation of large amounts of cell biology data. The hardware consists of an automatic XY-stage for moving a multiwell plate containing growing cells; a perfusion manifold allowing application of up to 8 different solutions; and a small epifluorescent microscope. It is extremely cheap (approximately £400 without and £2500 with a fluorescent microscope) and is easily customizable for individual experimental needs. We demonstrate the usability of this platform with high-throughput Ca2+ imaging and large-scale labelling experiments. All building instructions, software and PCB Gerber file are provided.&lt;/p>

It takes advantage of the n5 filesystem to allow for rapid and parallel data reading and writing. It performs automated image stitching, distributed and highly accurate multi-round image registration, 3D cell segmentation, and distributed spot detection. We also envision this workflow being adapted for analysis of other image-based spatial transcriptomic data.&lt;/p>

through internet based collaboration, starting on the DIYbio Google
Group. It is an evolution on the traditional capacitive discharge
circuit topology, instead using pulsed induction to enable a
programmable waveform as well as reduce the size, weight, and cost of
the equipment. With all these benefits, we hope to reduce the burden
of laboratory consumables for DNA transformation and electrofusion
procedures, where chemical supplies are currently relied on. The added
benefit of programmability allows many cell types to be manipulated by
altering the voltage level, or even giving the voltage profile a
particular shape.&lt;/p>

It uses 3D printed parts and common components that can be easily purchased. It can be used in microfluidics experiments or other applications. You can assemble it in a short-time for under $400. The system is modular and highly customizable. Examples of applications are: control the chemical environment of a bioreactor, purify proteins and precisely add reagents to chemical reactions over time.&lt;/p>

We think biologists should have robots to do pipetting for them. People doing science should be free of tedious benchwork and repetitive stress injuries. They should be able to spend their time designing experiments and analyzing data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s why we started Opentrons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We make robots for biologists. Our mission is to provide the scientific community with a common platform to easily share protocols and reproduce each other&amp;rsquo;s results. Our robots automate experiments that would otherwise be done by hand, allowing our community to spend more time pursuing answers to some of the 21st century’s most important questions&lt;/p>

First, a laboratory sample rotator is designed and demonstrated that can be used for tumbling as well as gentle mixing of samples in a variety of tube sizes by mixing them horizontally, vertically, or any position in between. Changing the mixing angle is fast and convenient and requires no tools. This device is battery powered and can be easily transported to operate in various locations in a lab including desktops, benches, clean hoods, chemical hoods, cold rooms, glove boxes, incubators or biological hoods. Second, an on-board Arduino-based microcontroller is incorporated that adds the functionality of a laboratory sample shaker. These devices can be customized both mechanically and functionally as the user can simply select the operation mode on the switch or alter the code to perform custom experiments. The open source laboratory sample rotator mixer can be built by non-specialists for under US$30 and adding shaking functionality can be done for under $20 more. Thus, these open source devices are technically superior to the proprietary commercial equipment available on the market while saving over 90% of the costs.&lt;/p>
