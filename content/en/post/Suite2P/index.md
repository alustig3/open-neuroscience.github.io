Suite2P is a very modular imaging processing pipeline written in Python which allows you to perform registration of raw data movies, automatic cell detection, extraction of calcium traces and infers spike times. It is a very fast and accurate tool and can work on standard workstations. It also includes a visualization graphical user interface (GUI) that facilitates analysis and manual curation of the cell detection algorithm.
