As a tool, it provides researchers with a toolkit of flexible modules to design experiments without rigid programming &amp;amp; API limitations. As a vision, it dreams of bridging the chaotic hacky creativity of scientific programmers with a standardized, communally developed library of hardware control interfaces and reproducible experiment prototypes. Autopilot is supplemented by a semantically-enabled wiki that hosts a library of DIY hardware designs and technical knowledge, use what&amp;rsquo;s there or submit your own: Autopilot is not prescriptive about what hardware you use, and can be extended to handle whatever you want to throw at it.&lt;/p>

The 3D printed centrifuge (Mobilefuge) is portable, robust, stable, safe, easy to build and operate. The Mobilefuge doesn’t require soldering or programming skills and can be built without any specialised equipment, yet practical enough for high throughput use. More importantly, Mobilefuge can be powered from widely available USB ports, including mobile phones and associated power supplies. This allows the Mobilefuge to be used even in off-grid and resource limited settings.&lt;/p>

To do so the device raises and lowers the temperature of the liquid in the small tubes. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a method widely used in molecular biology to make copies of a specific DNA segment. Applications of the technique include DNA cloning for sequencing, analysis of genetic fingerprints, amplification of ancient DNA and gene cloning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Simpler, smaller and more affordable. This ultra portable and compact thermocycler was designed with the goal to bring the cost down to affordable price for anyone who wants to do some Do-It-Your-Self biology with a DNA starter kit in his kitchen. The PocketPCR can be run from a simple USB power adapter. The device can be operated stand alone and all parameters can be set without the need of a computer or smartphone.&lt;/p>

It allows for automated daily oral dosing of mice over long time periods (weeks to months) without the need for experimenter interaction and handling. To accomplish this, a small 3D-printed chamber is mounted adjacent to a regular mouse home-cage, with an opening in the cage to allow animals to freely access the chamber.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The chamber is supported by a load cell, and does not contact the cage but sits directly next to the entrance opening. Prior to treatment, mice have a small RFID capsule implanted subcutaneously, and when they enter the chamber they are detected by an RFID reader. While the mouse is in the chamber, readings are taken from the load cell in order to determine the mouse&amp;rsquo;s bodyweight. At the opposite end of the chamber from the entrance, a nose-poke port accesses a spout which dispenses drops from two separate liquid reservoirs. This spout is wired to a capacitive touch sensor controller in order to detect licks, and delivers liquid drops in response to licking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Each day, an average weight is calculated for each mouse and a drug dosage is determined based on this. When a mouse licks at the spout it dispenses either regular drinking water or a drop of drug solution depending on if they have received their daily dosage or not. All components are controlled by a Python script running on a Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It provides timed stimulus presentation, interfacing with external devices and simultaneous real-time tracking of behavioral parameters such as position, orientation, tail and eye motion in both freely-swimming and head-restrained preparations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stytra logs all recorded quantities, metadata, and code version in standardized formats to allow full provenance tracking, from data acquisition through analysis to publication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The package is modular and expandable for different experimental protocols and setups. We also provide complete documentation with examples for extending the package to new stimuli and hardware, as well as a schema and parts list for behavioural setups.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The software can be used in the context of calcium imaging experiments by interfacing with other acquisition devices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our aims are to enable more laboratories to easily implement behavioral experiments, as well as to provide a platform for sharing stimulus protocols that permits easy reproduction of experiments and straightforward validation.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Though chosen for its ease of husbandry, maintaining large numbers of stocks of fruit flies, as done by many laboratories, is labour-intensive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One task which lends itself to automation is the production of the vials of food in which the flies are reared. Fly facilities typically have to generate several thousand vials of fly food each week to sustain their fly stocks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The system presented here combines a cartesian coordinate robot with a peristaltic pump. The design of the robot is based on an open hardware CNC (computer numerical control) machine, and uses belt and pulley actuators for the X and Y axes, and a leadscrew actuator for the Z axis.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CNC motion and operation of the peristaltic pump are controlled by grbl (&lt;a href="https://github.com/gnea/grbl),">https://github.com/gnea/grbl),&lt;/a> an open source, embedded, G-code parser. Grbl is written in optimized C and runs directly on an Arduino. A Raspberry Pi is used to generate and stream G-code instructions to Grbl.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A touch screen on the Raspberry Pi provides a graphical user interface to the system. Whilst the robot was built for the express purpose of filling vials of fly food, it could potentially be used for other liquid handling tasks in the laboratory.&lt;/p>

We think biologists should have robots to do pipetting for them. People doing science should be free of tedious benchwork and repetitive stress injuries. They should be able to spend their time designing experiments and analyzing data.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s why we started Opentrons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We make robots for biologists. Our mission is to provide the scientific community with a common platform to easily share protocols and reproduce each other&amp;rsquo;s results. Our robots automate experiments that would otherwise be done by hand, allowing our community to spend more time pursuing answers to some of the 21st century’s most important questions&lt;/p>

Many experiments provide rodents and primates with fluid rewards such as juice, water, or liquid sucrose. Current commercialized syringe pumps are not customizable and do not have the ability to deliver multiple volumes of fluid based on different inputs to the pump. Additionally, many syringe pumps are expensive and cannot be used in experiments with paired neurophysiological recordings due to electrical noise. We developed an open source syringe pump controller using commonly available parts. The controller adjusts the acceleration and speed of the motor to deliver three different volumes of fluid reward within one common time epoch. This syringe pump controller is cost effective and has been successfully implemented in rodent behavioral experiments with paired neurophysiological recordings in the rat frontal cortex while rats lick for different volumes of liquid sucrose rewards. Our syringe pump controller will enable new experiments to address the potential confound of temporal information in studies of reward signaling by fluid magnitude.&lt;/p>

First, a laboratory sample rotator is designed and demonstrated that can be used for tumbling as well as gentle mixing of samples in a variety of tube sizes by mixing them horizontally, vertically, or any position in between. Changing the mixing angle is fast and convenient and requires no tools. This device is battery powered and can be easily transported to operate in various locations in a lab including desktops, benches, clean hoods, chemical hoods, cold rooms, glove boxes, incubators or biological hoods. Second, an on-board Arduino-based microcontroller is incorporated that adds the functionality of a laboratory sample shaker. These devices can be customized both mechanically and functionally as the user can simply select the operation mode on the switch or alter the code to perform custom experiments. The open source laboratory sample rotator mixer can be built by non-specialists for under US$30 and adding shaking functionality can be done for under $20 more. Thus, these open source devices are technically superior to the proprietary commercial equipment available on the market while saving over 90% of the costs.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>he created a very interesting design for the PCR machine. Instead of using eppendorfs, he is using teflon tubes and three different heating elements, which allows for cheaper (he has a working PCR machine for 5 dollars!) and faster DNA amplifications.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Below is a video from David explaining the project:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It takes advantage of 3d printing technology to print an adaptor that goes on to a Dremel (a precision tool that has really high rotation rates). It was created by &lt;a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/cathalgarvey/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cathal&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
