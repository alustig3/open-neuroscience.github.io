Many scientists have benefited from the high-quality, ready-to-use AAV prep service from Addgene, a nonprofit plasmid repository. However, it can be challenging to determine which AAV tool and techniques are best to use for an experiment. Scientists also may have questions about how much virus to inject or which serotype or promoter should be used to target the desired neuron or brain region. To help scientists answer these questions, Addgene launched an open platform called the AAV Data Hub (&lt;a href="https://datahub.addgene.org/aav/">https://datahub.addgene.org/aav/&lt;/a>) which allows researchers to easily share practical experimental details with the scientific community (AAV used, in vivo model used, injection site, injection volumes, etc.). The goal of this platform is to help scientists find the best AAV tool for their experiments by reviewing combined data from a broad range of research labs. The AAV Data Hub launched in late 2019 and over 100 experiments have since been contributed to this project. The dataset includes details and images from experiments conducted in six different species and several different expression sites.&lt;/p>

Our solution is an open-source hardware that allows for automatic high-throughput generation of large amounts of cell biology data. The hardware consists of an automatic XY-stage for moving a multiwell plate containing growing cells; a perfusion manifold allowing application of up to 8 different solutions; and a small epifluorescent microscope. It is extremely cheap (approximately £400 without and £2500 with a fluorescent microscope) and is easily customizable for individual experimental needs. We demonstrate the usability of this platform with high-throughput Ca2+ imaging and large-scale labelling experiments. All building instructions, software and PCB Gerber file are provided.&lt;/p>

It uses 3D printed parts and common components that can be easily purchased. It can be used in microfluidics experiments or other applications. You can assemble it in a short-time for under $400. The system is modular and highly customizable. Examples of applications are: control the chemical environment of a bioreactor, purify proteins and precisely add reagents to chemical reactions over time.&lt;/p>

The use of widely available consumables and 3D printing, together with documentation and software, offers an extremely low-cost and accessible alternative for both education and research areas. In order to reduce the entry barrier, we provide a fully comprehensive toolbox called TheBOX. A paper describing the scientific application in detail can be found &lt;a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.02.973073v1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

The microscope uses a Raspberry Pi mini-computer with an 8MP camera to capture images and videos. Stepper motors and the illumination are controlled using a circuit board comprising an Arduino microcontroller, six stepper motor drivers and a high-power LED driver. All functions can be controlled from a keyboard connected to the Raspberry Pi or a separate custom-built Arduino joystick connected to the mainboard. LEGO bricks are used to construct the main body of the microscope to achieve a modular and easy-to-assemble design concept.&lt;/p>
