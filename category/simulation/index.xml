&lt;p>The reasons for this project are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The bee brain has way less neurons than the brain of rodents (but still in the order of 10^6 neurons!), so understanding how this simple brain works could be a nice step towards understanding more complex brains.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The bee population has been declining and scientists are not exactly sure why.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understanding bee behaviour and the organ that produces them might help solve the problem&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improvement of unmanned aerial vehicle control&lt;/li>

The creators made them in a way that each hardware neuron has excitatory and inhibitory inputs and one output that can be split up to affect dowsntream neurons. They are also cheap enough so that one can build several of them and wire them together to see which properties will emerge in the system. Design files are available on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/neurotinker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project&amp;rsquo;s GitHub organization&lt;/a>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Big Neuron</title><link>https://open-neuroscience.com/post/big-neuron/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuroscience.com/post/big-neuron/</guid><description>&lt;p>Big Neuron wants to create a standard for the field of single neuron reconstruction. Because the data available comes from different structures, different organisms, using different collection and analyses algorithms and is in the range of petabytes (according to the project site), there is a strong need for standards that will allow this huge amount of data to be compared.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project aims to develop a common platform and algorithms for data analysis to benchmark as many open source neuronal reconstruction models as possible.&lt;/p>
