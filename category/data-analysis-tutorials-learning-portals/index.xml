As a hub, TrainingSpace provides users with access to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Multimedia educational content from courses, conference lectures, and laboratory exercises from some of the world’s leading neuroscience institutes and societies&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Study tracks to facilitate self-guided study&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Tutorials on tools and open science resources for neuroscience research&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A Q&amp;amp;A forum&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A neuroscience encyclopedia that provides users with access to over 1.000.000 publicly available datasets as well as links to literature references and scientific abstracts&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Topics currently included in TrainingSpace include: general neuroscience, clinical neuroscience, computational neuroscience, neuroinformatics, computer science, data science, and open science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All courses and conference lectures in TrainingSpace include a general description, topics covered, links to prerequisite courses if applicable, and links to software described in or required for the course, as well as links to the next lecture in the course or more advanced related courses. In addition to providing resources for students and researchers, TrainingSpace also provides resources for instructors, such laboratory exercises, open science services, and access to publicly available datasets and models.&lt;/p>
