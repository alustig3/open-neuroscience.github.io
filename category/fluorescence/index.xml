Morphological analysis is a time-consuming exercise requiring meticulous manual tracing of cellular contours and extensions. We have developed a software tool, called SMorph, to rapidly analyse the morphology of cells of the nervous system. SMorph performs completely automated Sholl analysis. It extracts 23 morphometric features based on cell images and Sholl analysis parameters, followed by Principal Component Analysis. SMorph is tested on neurons, astrocytes and microglia and reveals subtle changes in cell morphology. Using SMorph, we found that chronic 21-day treatment with antidepressant desipramine results in a significant structural remodeling in hippocampal astrocytes. Given the proposed involvement of astroglial structural changes and atrophy in major depression in humans, our results reveal a novel kind of structural plasticity induced by chronic antidepressant administration.&lt;/p>

You can either build it fully DIY or purchase the basic scope ready made and upgrade it as required (see below for details). It uses professional quality optics including the option of full Kohler illumination and oil-immersion, and has some very advanced features not usually found on even the most expensive commercially available microscopes. This includes a computer-controlled and programmable TFT-screen-based Spatial Light Modulator for optical Fourier filtration allowing for optimised / dynamic / adaptive apertures. Also, unique to any 3D printed microscope to date, an augmented reality projector system - which is also programmable. Some advanced applications you can do with these are AI microscopy, specimen-directed aperture optimisation, digital measurements, 3D tomography, Fourier ptychography, Schlieren phase contrast and more.
The system is fully customisable - the original FreeCAD source files are all available on the GitHub page so you can customise the scope to meed your individual project needs. The PUMA system is also peer reviewed and published in the Journal of Microscopy ( &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmi.13043">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jmi.13043&lt;/a> ) so you can easily reference it if you use a PUMA system for your own research.
If the DIY aspect puts you off then fully built &amp;lsquo;Foundation scope&amp;rsquo; configuration PUMA microscopes (i.e. the full working basic microscope without advanced add-ons) can be purchased from the OptArc store (international tracked delivery is available) at &lt;a href="https://www.optarc.co.uk">https://www.optarc.co.uk&lt;/a> where you can also download detailed user manuals as PDF files (free of charge) - just visit the &amp;lsquo;Support&amp;rsquo; pages.&lt;/p>

Meeting this challenge requires tools capable of recording and manipulating the activity of intact neural networks in freely behaving animals. Head-mounted miniature fluorescence microscopes are among the most promising of these tools. Taking advantage of the past decade&amp;rsquo;s advancements in fluorescent neural activity reporters, these microscopes use wide-field single photon excitation to image activity across large populations of neurons in freely behaving animals. They are capable of imaging the same neural population across months and in a wide range of animal models and different brain regions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Initiated six years ago, the Miniscope Project &amp;ndash; an open-source collaborative effortâ€”was created to accelerate innovation of miniature microscope technology and to increase global access to this technology. Currently, we are working on advancements ranging from optogenetic stimulation and wire-free operation to simultaneous optical and electrophysiological recording. Using these systems, we have uncovered mechanisms underlying temporal memory linking and investigated causes of cognitive deficits in temporal lobe epilepsy. Through innovation and optimization, this work aims to extend the reach of neuroscience research and create new avenues of scientific inquiry.&lt;/p>

From your 2D brain slice images you can build a 3D expression surface from a brain structure such as the isocortex or the hippocampus. You can then convert the 3D surfaces into 2D expression maps, get depth-based expression or identify digital micro-punches for analysis.&lt;/p>

Our solution is an open-source hardware that allows for automatic high-throughput generation of large amounts of cell biology data. The hardware consists of an automatic XY-stage for moving a multiwell plate containing growing cells; a perfusion manifold allowing application of up to 8 different solutions; and a small epifluorescent microscope. It is extremely cheap (approximately Â£400 without and Â£2500 with a fluorescent microscope) and is easily customizable for individual experimental needs. We demonstrate the usability of this platform with high-throughput Ca2+ imaging and large-scale labelling experiments. All building instructions, software and PCB Gerber file are provided.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Itâ€™s a work in progress, but cellfinder can:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Detect labelled cells in 3D in whole-brain images (many hundreds of GB)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Register the image to an atlas (such as the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Segment the brain based on the reference atlas&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Calculate the volume of each brain area, and the number of labelled cells within it&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Transform everything into standard space for analysis and visualisation&lt;/li>
